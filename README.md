# Car-Price-Predictor
**A Machine learning Project** that uses linear regression algorithm to predict the price of used car.The dataset for this is taken from quikr.

Linear regression is a linear model, e.g. a model that assumes a linear relationship between the input variables (x) and the single output variable (y). More specifically, 
that y can be calculated from a linear combination of the input variables (x).

When there is a single input variable (x), the method is referred to as simple linear regression. When there are multiple input variables, literature from statistics often r
efers to the method as multiple linear regression.
